🛡️ Breach Insights Dashboard
A modular analytics dashboard for visualizing technical breach patterns, remediation actions, and infrastructure exposure based on PDPC case files.

📊 Modules
1. Taxonomy Frequency
Visualizes breach tags extracted from case files to highlight recurring patterns.
Taxonomy Chart
2. Remediation Actions
Shows how organizations responded to breaches and the effectiveness of those remediations.
Remediation Chart

📁 Data Exports
Structured datasets are auto-generated by each Python module and stored in /data/:
| Module | CSV Output | 
| Taxonomy Frequency | data/taxonomy.csv | 
| Remediation Effectiveness | data/remediation.csv | 

🔧 Scripts
| Script | Function | 
| taxonomy_modelling.py | Loads breach tags and saves chart + CSV | 
| remediation_effectiveness.py | Analyzes remediation types and saves chart + CSV | 
All scripts auto-export visuals to /visuals/ and data to /data/ for GitHub integration.

📌 Next Modules (Coming Soon)
- infrastructure_risks.py — platform exposure mapping
- vendor_flows.py — accountability linkage
- cooccurrence_matrix.py — tag pair frequency
- credential_hygiene.py — protection surface modeling

🧪 Methodology
This dashboard synthesizes technical breach records and tags them using a custom taxonomy across categories like:
- Data exposure vectors
- Authentication failures
- Third-party oversight
- Retention & access hygiene
Built with Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib) and PowerShell scripting for orchestration.
